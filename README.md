Mi primer proyecto con git

- The OS flavor: Lubuntu 20.04 
-Programs: Python 3.8.5
-This zip contains two scripts called norep.py and testrep.py.

-norep.py
This program reads a string S and identifies if S was formed by concatenating a string T with itself one or more times. The program needs a given input.

To run it, write in terminal 'python3 (path)/norep.py'.

Where'path' is the location of the script. Then, the program will ask you for an input string to return the minimum value.

-testrep.py
This program uses the function norepf in norep.py with different input values and compares norep's output against expected results. The program itself generates the string to test the norepf function.

To run it, write in terminal 'python3 (path)/testrep.py'.

The output is the generated string S, the ground truth of string T, and the string T calculated by the function norepf.
